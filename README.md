# easy-apply-ats
Easy Apply Application Tracking System

This repository builds upon the original [Automated Bots - Easy Apply Jobs Bot](https://github.com/wodsuz/EasyApplyJobsBot), enhancing the automated process with LinkedIn's Easy Apply feature.  It addresses a few compatibility issues with the former codebase on the Linkedin website.  Most importantly, an issue with the *unfollow* feature is addressed so that you will not return in one hour to find that there are one thousand profiles you follow on Linkedin.  Also, we introduce the recording of company names, position titles, and job descriptions so that you are prepared for your callbacks!  At last, we debut advanced analytics capabilities and a Dockerized Grafana dashboard for real-time application monitoring.  This all comes preconfigured so you are ready to go with applying to every job, and keyword matches are configurable by setting in *config.py*.
