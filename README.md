## Tests üî¶

There is a specific test folder for you to test the dependencies, the bot and if everything is set up correctly. To do that I recommend,
running below codes,

1. Go to the tests folder run `python3 setupTests.py` this will output if Python,pip,selenium,dotenv and Firefox are installed correctly on your system.
2. Run `python3 seleniumTest.py` this will output if the Selenium and gecko driver is able to retrieve data from a website. If it returns an error make sure you have correctly installed selenium and gecko driver
3. Run `python3 linkedinTest.py` this will try to log in automatically to your Linkedin account based on the path you defined in the .env file. If its giving an error make sure the path exists and you created firefox profile, logged in manually to your Linkedin account once.
   Here is the result you should get after running test files,

## How to Set up (long old way) üõ†

This tutorial briefly explains how to set up LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs bot. With few modifications you can make your own bot or try my other bots for other platforms.

4. Install pip, python get-pip.py
5. Install selenium pip install selenium
6. Clone the code

10. Paste the root folder on .env file
11. Modify/adapt the code and run
12. After each run check the jobs that the bot didn‚Äôt apply automatically, apply them manually by saving your preferences

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details><summary> How to install and run the bot? </summary>
<br>
To install the bot simply clone the repo, install required packages (these are dependencies making the bot run properly), enter your credentials & edit the config file based on your preferences and run the bot with the command python3 [thePlatformName].py
<br><br>
To run the bot you need Python (general-purpose programming language), Pip (package manager for Python), Selenium (for browser automation) and some dependencies to be installed on your device. For more information and details, you can check the installation of each project on their specific site shown below.
</details>

<details><summary> Instalization is too complicated can you make it easier? </summary>
<br>
Yes, we are trying to improve the process of instalization meanwhile you can purchase and use the step by step instalization tutorials to install the bot properly on your device
</details>

<details><summary> What are the features of these bots? </summary>
<br>
Currently automated bots hold 3 different subgroups under one umbrella. One for applying for jobs automatically, one for listing businesses automatically and one for swiping & messaging automatically in dating apps. You can check the features of each bot on the homepage and their own GitHub repository that I share and update regularly. 
</details>

<details><summary> How much does it cost & how can I pay? </summary>
<br>
Each bot has a free and paid version. The free version comes with an open-source license that you can change & modify. For paid ones, you need to purchase coins and those coins will be deducted whenever the bot successfully acts (applying for jobs successfully, listing companies successfully or swiping & sending messages successfully). You can check our shop for the prices of each product. 
</details>

<details><summary> Would i get banned or my account be blocked? </summary>
<br>
No, since you run the bot on your own device and the traffic is coming from your own address, the risks of getting banned from any of the websites we support is very low. This is because you run the bot on your own device, your traffic will be similar with your own actions and the bot will act humanely meaning it will perform stopping waiting and skipping actions randomly.Meanwhile we dont recommend applying more than 200 jobs per day via job apply bot.
</details>

<details><summary>I have an error while running the bot, how can i fix? </summary>
<br>
When you have an error related to any of the bots. Please check the github project first. Someone else also might post a similar error. Then if its free version try Google the error, if that doesn't work kindly contact with us with our contact page.
</details>

<details><summary>What are the terms and rules of using these bots? </summary>
<br>
The free version comes with an open source license. You are free to modify and work in any way you want. Paid version comes with limited license meaning that you accept and approve that you will be using the bot for you only and you won't modify/sell/commercialize or steal in any way 
</details>

<details><summary>Linkedin pro bot will apply unanswered / additional questions? </summary>
<br>
Yes. Linkedin pro has several features for unanswered or additional questions. Firstly, it can answer a question based on Linkedin‚Äôs default value from previous applications of yours. Secondly, it can apply from a questions file - you need to add custom questions and answers in order for the bot to apply, thirdly AI can answer the questions for you. 
</details>

<details><summary>Do you have a bot for x website? </summary>
<br>
We currently support the sites we sell in our shop. Please check our shop in order to see if we support or not. We constantly add and update the bot, in the future we will have social media accounts to provide you better and faster updates. 
</details>

## Future Implementations

- Add full support to other major job seeking websites (Glassdoor, AngelCo https://angel.co/l/2xRADV, Greenhouse, https://cryptocurrencyjobs.co/, Monster, GLobalLogic, djinni)
